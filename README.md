## Introduction: 

  Booked is an open source web based application specially designed to improve scheduling and manage resource utilization. It is written in PHP and uses MySQL or MariaDB to store its data. It is a simple and powerful scheduler with flexible layouts, administrative backend and custom rules. Booked comes with lots of features including reservation start and end reminders, user-based security, flexible quota system, export to Outlook, reservation reminders, and much more.

## Get Started

  The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

## Pre Requisites

1. PHP 7.4, PHP 8+
    i) Recommended minimum 256MB memory allocated to PHP
    ii) gdlib enabled
4. MySQL 5.6 or greater
5. Web server
 
## Installation:

  The most important settings for installation are script.url and the database settings. script.url should be pointed to the full, public URL for Booked including /Web. Ensure these are correct before continuing with the installation. To configure the application, open /config/config.php and update any settings accordingly. Note: If you try to load the application at this time, you will probably get a blank page. This is because there is no database configured yet.
